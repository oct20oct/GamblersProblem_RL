Reinforcement Learning, Gambler's Problem, bet sizing


Gambler's problem. The gambler has a stake s between 0 and 100. At each
play he wagers an integer <= s. He wins that much with prob p, else he
loses that much. If he builds his stake to 100 he wins (thus he never
wagers more than (- 100 s)); if his stake falls to 0 he loses.
